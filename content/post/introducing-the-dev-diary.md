I'm building a tool for improving financial habits. Something to help realize how much you spend, how much you want to spend, and how to minimize the difference.

I want the work to be completely in the open, so I'm starting an accompanying dev diary.

The target is to post a new article every week on the progress, and some related technical aspect. Either a problem I had to solve, or an interesting aspect of a related technology, or retrospective evaluations of decisions made before.

It will not necessarily be a "tech blog". As I'm building a financial tool, and hoping to integrate it with financial APIs, there might be regulatory aspects to it as well. For example:

- what does the regulation to access bank APIs mean? 
- what are the regulatory differences in providing services in the EU vs the US
- what are the costs of getting licenced to do X
- etc.

Finally, one last aspect that will likely be mentioned here, is the indie hacking aspect of it. This is not a day job, nor is the ultimate goal for it to necessarily become one. The goal is to make something useful. For myself (primarily) and others (aspirationally), while having a full time job, and spending time with family.

So expect the occasional post about trying to debug a background process while at the playground, or bringing kids to a customer interview, or about building a productive sideproject work cadence around date nights.

Things like that. To kick this off, here's:
- [an overview of the planned architecture](#)
- [a post about how I set up authentication, and the hurdles I had with JWT in the chosen architecture](#)
